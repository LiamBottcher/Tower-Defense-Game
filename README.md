# WELCOME
This is my java tower defense game I am working on as one of my side projects during the school year. I'm using the swing library that comes in vanilla java, and am closely following a tutorial of 39 videos created by Kaarin Gaming. 

That being said I spend a lot of time each video taking high quuality notes and actually learning the in depth parts of the swing toolkit and the logic behind this tower defense game. 

I'm doing this because it's really fun for me to work on something I'm passionate about and adapting to this new library can help me in the future if I have to adapt to a specific library used on a future job
